# Day 2: Intro to Blockchain Theory and Consensus Mechanism
## What is a Blockchain?

Everyone is talking about cryptocurrencies, blockchain, NFTs, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Shiba INU, etc. All these topics have become trendy, and there's a lot of information about them on the internet. But, what does it mean? Why is everyone talking about them? What makes them so demanding and popular?

In this lesson, we will talk about blockchain as it is the underlying technology behind all this.

But, before defining a blockchain, let's try to understand the reason why we need a blockchain? And what problems does it solve?

To understand why we need a blockchain, first, let's try to understand the meaning of "centralized systems".

A centralized system is a network of computers that depend on the main computer (i.e. central point), also known as a server. All the data is stored and controlled by this server.

But, what is wrong with a centralized system? What are the problems that a centralized company could face in the long run? Here are some of them:

The nodes (i.e. computers) participating in this network depend on a single server. So, this provides hackers with a small surface area which makes it easier for them to attack and exploit a server.

A server is controlled by a few people of an organization who could always exploit the server. Thus, a server is prone to get attacked by the internal members of an organization.

Servers are highly dependent on a network connection. If a server goes down due to connectivity issues then all the nodes depending on that server go down with it.

Now, let's focus on how blockchain technology can solve these problems.

Blockchain is a decentralized network. Hence, it does not have a central authority responsible for managing and distributing data. Instead, the data is distributed (i.e. duplicated) to the nodes participating in this network.

The participating nodes are the ones who manage a blockchain network. So if any node tries to change the data, then this modification has to be validated by the other nodes. And, if the other nodes find out that this modification is incorrect then they will reject it.

Blockchain can tackle network issues as it consists of many nodes. So, the entire network won't be affected if a single node goes down. 

## So, what does the term "blockchain" mean?

Blockchain is a public database for storing real-world data, shared and updated with many nodes (computers) across the globe. In technical terms, blockchain is a collection of blocks linked to each other. 

Let's break this down in simple terms. The word "blockchain" consists of two parts: block and chain.

"Block" is an entity that stores any real-world data. For our convenience, let's assume that a block stores the transactions happening on the internet. If Holly sends 5 ETH (Ethers) to Molly, this transaction needs to be added to a block to be successful.

"Chain" can be defined as a cryptographic link of a block with the previous block. In other words, the link between blocks forms a chain of blocks. So, to sum it up, blockchain is a collection of blocks chained together using cryptography.

## Features of Blockchain

Blockchain is an immutable(unchangeable, ) data storage that is

Decentralized: There is no central authority that controls the blockchain. Blockchain is a distributed technology and it is not controlled by anyone.

Peer To Peer: Blockchain is a distributed technology shared among the nodes (i.e. peers) participating in the network. 

Trustless: The word "trustless" is a fundamental part of blockchain technology. People have always been dependent on third-party organizations such as banks, people or any other intermediaries. But with blockchain technology, people don't have to rely on any third party for their transactions and holdings.

Secure: Blockchain uses decentralization, cryptography and consensus at its core which makes it secure.

## How does blockchain work?

Every blockchain begins with a Genesis Block, and it is the first block of a blockchain. A Block is limited in size and can store a limited number of transactions.

Let's assume that we have three blocks with some transactions stored in them. To link these blocks, every block is assigned with a unique hash id that is generated using the data present in that block. So when someone tries to modify a Block, the hash id of that block changes as well.

Now, the hash id of the first block is stored in the second block. And the hash id of the second block is stored in the third block. This process is repeated for all the subsequent blocks. Thus, we have a chain of blocks referred to as the "blockchain".

By the way, this is what a hash id looks like for "Molly sends 5 ETH to Holly".

"Molly sends 5 ETH to Holly" is an example. In a real-world case scenario, it could be a transaction.

## What does ETH mean?

ETH is the symbol for Ether cryptocurrency. Ether is the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain.

Every blockchain has its own currency that users can use to make transactions. For example, the currency supported by the Bitcoin blockchain is Bitcoin.

## What are Blockchain Layers?

```Layer 0```

Layer 0 of a blockchain network consists of components such as the internet, hardware, and connections that support the smooth functioning of Layer 1.

```Layer 1```

A layer one protocol also known as an "implementation layer", refers to the core architecture of a blockchain network. It forms the foundational base of any blockchain network. A layer one protocol defines a set of rules for operations like transaction throughput, block time, consensus algorithm, etc., that governs the entire network. For example, Ethereum is temporarily using a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm before transitioning to a proof-of-stake (PoS) network. 

```Layer 2```

Layer 2 is a framework that provides a full-fledged solution to Layer 1 to improve its overall performance.

## Why do we need Layer 2?

Currently, Layer 1 is facing problems such as low transaction throughput (i.e. no. of transactions per second) and performance due to the increasing number of users. Layer 1 uses the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm that requires high computational power. This approach is more secure, however, affects the performance.

To solve this problem, Layer 2 acts like a third-party integration that works in conjunction with Layer 1. With this, a part of the work that has to be done by Layer 1 will be done by Layer 2. Layer 2 will still be following the protocols of Layer 1 while carrying out the work.

Some examples of Layer 2 solutions are Polygon Matic for Ethereum and Bitcoin Lightning Network for Bitcoin.

```Layer 3```

Layer 3 is a layer on top of Layer 1 and Layer 2 that enables the development of applications also known as decentralized applications (Dapps). This layer hosts these applications and also defines the protocols for them.

In simple words, this layer allows users to interact with a blockchain.

Bitcoin is not a programmable blockchain, which means that it does not support decentralized applications. Whereas, blockchains such as Ethereum and Solana have become the best platforms for developing decentralized applications. 

## Popular Blockchain Networks

## Bitcoin

Bitcoin is a digital currency that uses blockchain technology to record its transactions. It was created in January 2009 by a mysterious guy named Satoshi Nakamoto.

## Ethereum

Ethereum is a blockchain technology powering its currency (i.e Ethers) and many decentralized applications. As discussed earlier, it's a programmable blockchain that supports many applications in different domains. It was created in July 2015 by Vitalik Buterin. 

## Binance

Binance started as a marketplace for trading crypto assets. It supports its cryptocurrency (i.e. BNB). In the beginning, BNB was dependent on the Ethereum blockchain, but now has its own blockchain known as Binance Chain. Binance was founded in 2017 by Changpeng Zhao.
